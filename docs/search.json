I hope this site and the accompanying [GitHub repo](https://github.com/hschuett/BayesForAccountingResearch) will help those interested in Bayesian methods to find a starting point. Hopefully you find it useful.\n",

The first part provides the annotated code to produce the output and figures used in the paper (the GitHub repo also contains the code to compute the data used). Code can be copied easily to the clipboard and be reused. The second part is still under development and contains additional material useful to those interested in Bayesian analysis.\r\nPaper code\r\nSection 2: Simulation contains all the code to replicate the figures and results from Section 2, which compares Classical hypothesis testing to Bayesian inference.\r\nAdditional material\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
